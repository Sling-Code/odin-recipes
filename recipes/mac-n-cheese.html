    <h2>Baked is Better</h2>
    <p>
      Mac and cheese is a creamy and cheesy dish that is made with macaroni
      pasta and cheese sauce. It is a comfort food that can be enjoyed as a main
      course or a side dish. Mac and cheese is easy to make and can be
      customized with different kinds of cheese, toppings, and add-ins
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many ways to make mac and cheese, such as stovetop, oven-baked,
      or microwave. You can also use different kinds of pasta, such as shells,
      penne, or rotini. The cheese sauce can be made with a roux, a bechamel, or
      a combination of cheese and milk. You can also add some extra flavor and
      texture with ingredients like bacon, ham, broccoli, peas, or breadcrumbs.
