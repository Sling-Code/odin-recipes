    <h2>A Classic Italian Dish</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of pasta,
      cheese, meat sauce, and béchamel sauce. It is baked in the oven until
      golden and bubbly, and then served hot with a green salad and some bread.
      Lasagna is a hearty and satisfying meal that can feed a large crowd or be
      frozen for later use.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many variations of lasagna, depending on the region, preference,
      and availability of ingredients. Some common types of lasagna are
      vegetarian, seafood, spinach and ricotta, mushroom, and chicken. You can
      also customize your lasagna by using different kinds of pasta, cheese, and
      sauce. The basic steps of making lasagna are the same, regardless of the
      type you choose.

      <li>15 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of chopped parsley</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of flour</li>
      <li>2 cups of milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="list-head">Here are the steps to make the lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water,
        according to the package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water.
        Lay them flat on a baking sheet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef, breaking
        it up with a spatula, until browned and cooked through. Drain the excess
        fat and transfer the meat to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, cook the onion and garlic until soft, about 5
        minutes. Add the marinara sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and
        simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and
        pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and stir in the ricotta cheese,
        parsley, nutmeg, and half of the parmesan cheese. Season with salt and
        pepper to taste
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and whisk in the
        flour. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the
        milk and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes,
        stirring frequently, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce over the
        bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 4 noodles over the sauce,
        slightly overlapping. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the
        noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat with
        another layer of sauce, noodles, ricotta, and mozzarella. Top with the
        remaining sauce, noodles, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes, or
        until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the cheese is
        golden and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
